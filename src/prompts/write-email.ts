   - Determine the appropriate level of formality based on the relationship, context, and desired tone (e.g., formal for business, casual for personal).

3. **Draft the Email:**
   - Begin with a greeting that matches the desired tone (e.g., formal: "Dear [Title] [Last Name]," informal: "Hi [First Name],").
   - Clearly state the purpose of the email in the opening paragraph, using language suited to the tone.
   - Develop the body with necessary details, maintaining clarity and the appropriate tone.
   - Conclude with a closing remark that fits the tone (e.g., formal: "Sincerely," informal: "Best," or "Thanks,").

4. **Polish the Draft:**

   - Ensure the tone is consistent and appropriate for the context and relationship.
   - Correct any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, or formatting issues.
